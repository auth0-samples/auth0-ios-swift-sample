# Swift Sample Application

This sample application demonstrates the integration of the [Auth0.swift](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.swift) SDK into a Swift iOS / macOS application. The sample is a companion to the [Auth0 Swift Quickstart](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/native/ios-swift).

## Requirements

- iOS 15+ / macOS 11+
- Xcode 14.x

## Configuration

### 1. Configure Bundle Identifier

Open `SwiftSample.xcodeproj` in Xcode and go to the settings of the application target you want to run. There are two application targets available: **SwiftSample (iOS)** and **SwiftSample (macOS)**. In the **General** tab, change the default bundle identifier from `com.auth0.samples.SwiftSample` to another value of your choosing.

### 2. Configure Auth0 Application

Go to the settings page of your [Auth0 application](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/) and add the corresponding URL to **Allowed Callback URLs** and **Allowed Logout URLs**, according to the application target you want to run. If you are using a [custom domain](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/custom-domains), replace `YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN` with the value of your custom domain instead of the value from the settings page.

#### SwiftSample (iOS)

```text
YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN/ios/YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER/callback
```

#### SwiftSample (macOS)

```text
YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN/macos/YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER/callback
```

For example, if your iOS bundle identifier was `com.company.myapp` and your Auth0 Domain was `company.us.auth0.com`, then this value would be:

```text
com.company.myapp://company.us.auth0.com/ios/com.company.myapp/callback
```

> ⚠️ Make sure that the [application type](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/applications) of the Auth0 application is **Native**. If you don’t have a Native Auth0 application already, [create one](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications/native-apps) before continuing.

### 3. Configure Auth0.swift

Rename the `Auth0.plist.example` file to `Auth0.plist`, and replace the placeholder `{CLIENT_ID}` and `{DOMAIN}` values with the Client ID and Domain of your Auth0 application. If you are using a [custom domain](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/custom-domains), use the value of your custom domain instead of the value from the settings page.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>ClientId</key>
    <string>{CLIENT_ID}</string>
    <key>Domain</key>
    <string>{DOMAIN}</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple sources](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers), either social identity providers such as **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce** (amongst others), or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS, or any SAML identity provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/database-connections/custom-db)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/user-account-linking)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [JSON Web Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when, and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile through [JavaScript Actions](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions).

**Why Auth0?** Because you should save time, be happy, and focus on what really matters: building your product.
