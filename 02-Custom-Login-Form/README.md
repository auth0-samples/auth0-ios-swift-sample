### Important: Database Connection Authentication

Since June 2017 new Clients no longer have the **Password Grant Type*** enabled by default. This means that Database Connection Authentication from *Public clients* such as a mobile app, require the Password Grant Type to be enabled.
To enable the Password Grant Type please follow [this guide](https://auth0.com/docs/clients/client-grant-types#how-to-edit-the-client-grant_types-property).

The reasons for this change are listed in the [embedded vs native mobile article](https://auth0.com/docs/tutorials/browser-based-vs-native-experience-on-mobile).
